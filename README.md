# Runtriggers

Runtriggers is a multi-user web application in which users can set up one or more "scripts", which are small programs to be run when defined conditions are met. Runtriggers takes care of running the programs, saving their textual output, saving the start time and run duration, and sending email notifications in case of extraordinary events.
